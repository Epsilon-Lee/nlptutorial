### Word Segmentation: unigram language model + viterbi

> Written by jf.deng

#### Data files

1. `poeple-daily.txt`: train set for uni-gram lm. 
2. `zh-ws-test.txt`: test set, constructred for visualization convenience. 

#### Run the code

Running codes in two ways:
1. First, train a unigram LM, then, do decoding for word segmentation.
2. Load a unigram LM directly, then, do decoding.

Caveat: Please use **Python2**
